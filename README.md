# 🐍 Python Playground

**Python Playground** — a sandbox where I experiment, practice, break things, and level up.

This repo is a collection of Python scripts, notebooks, and mini-experiments covering:

- Data structures & algorithms
- Python fundamentals
- Random coding ideas
- Practice problems
- Quick tests and throwaway prototypes

Nothing here is “perfect” — everything here is **learning in progress**.

---

## 📁 What you’ll find

- `.py` files for quick scripts & practice
- Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- Algorithm & logic practice
- Notes and snippets I don’t want to forget

---

## 🚀 Why this exists

- Practice > theory
- Build muscle memory
- Track progress over time
- Have a place to freely experiment without pressure

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a **playground**, not a production repo.
Expect:

- Messy code
- Half-finished ideas
- Refactors in progress

That’s the point.

---

## 🛠 Tech

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓 (when needed)

---

## 📌 Notes

If you’re browsing this repo:

- Feel free to explore
- Steal ideas
- Ignore bad code 😄

Progress over perfection.
